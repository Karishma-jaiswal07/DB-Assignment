Answer 1 . The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities in the provided diagram is a one-to-many relationship. This means that one product belongs to only one product category, but a product category can have multiple products associated with it.In terms of the database schema, the "Product" entity has a foreign key column called "product_category_id" that references the primary key column "id" in the "Product_Category" entity. This establishes the relationship between the two entities, allowing each product to be categorized under a specific product category.
Answer 2 . To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce referential integrity using a foreign key constraint. In the database schema, you would define a foreign key constraint on the "product_category_id" column in the "Product" table, referencing the primary key column "id" in the "Product_Category" table.
Here's how we can implement it:
ALTER TABLE Product
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_product_category
FOREIGN KEY (product_category_id)
REFERENCES Product_Category(id);
With this foreign key constraint in place, the database will prevent the insertion or updating of a product record if the associated product category does not exist in the "Product_Category" table. This ensures that each product always has a valid category assigned to it.
